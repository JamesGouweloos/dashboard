# Class Filter Implementation - Full Table Filtering

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

The booking class filter now applies to the **entire table**, including yearly and monthly breakdowns. This enables comprehensive troubleshooting and data verification.

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. **Data Processing Updates** (`process_booking_data.py`)

Added two new data structures to the output:
- `yearly_breakdown_by_class`: Breakdown by booking class per year
- `monthly_breakdown_by_class`: Breakdown by booking class per month

### 2. **Component Updates** (`BreakdownTable.tsx`)

Added intelligent data source switching:
- **Default**: Uses status-based breakdown (`yearly_breakdown`, `monthly_breakdown`)
- **When Class Filter Active**: Switches to class-based breakdown (`yearly_breakdown_by_class`, `monthly_breakdown_by_class`)

### 3. **Dynamic Filtering Logic**

The component now:
- Detects when booking class filter is active
- Switches data source automatically
- Applies filters to both summary and detailed views
- Maintains all filtering capabilities

## üìä How It Works

### Filter Behavior

**Scenario 1: Default (Both Filters = "All")**
- Shows status-based breakdown (Confirmed/Provisional)
- All data visible

**Scenario 2: Class Filter Active**
- Switches to class-based breakdown
- Shows Income Generating / Non-Income Generating
- Column headers change dynamically
- All yearly/monthly data respects class filter

**Scenario 3: Both Filters Active**
- Class filter: Uses class-based data
- Status filter: Filters within class-based view
- Combined filtering for precise analysis

## üéØ Troubleshooting Features

### 1. **Verify Income vs Non-Income Bookings**
- Set Class filter to "Income Generating"
- See only revenue-generating bookings
- Check yearly and monthly trends

### 2. **Identify Non-Revenue Activities**
- Set Class filter to "Non-Income Generating"  
- View all non-revenue bookings
- Spot patterns or issues

### 3. **Cross-Reference with Status**
- Apply Class filter first
- Then apply Status filter
- View Income + Confirmed bookings only
- Compare against Income + Provisional

### 4. **Data Validation**
- Compare summary totals with detailed breakdowns
- Verify income/disbursements calculations
- Check bed nights align across views
- Confirm revenue totals match

## üìà What's Filtered Now

### Summary Section
‚úÖ Booking Class Summary Table (top)
- Filtered by selected class
- Shows count, revenue, bed nights, etc.

### Yearly Breakdown
‚úÖ Year-by-year summary tables
‚úÖ Expands to show monthly details
‚úÖ All metrics filtered by class

### Monthly Breakdown  
‚úÖ Month-by-month detail tables
‚úÖ Expandable per month
‚úÖ Full metric breakdown
‚úÖ Class filter respected throughout

## üßÆ Data Verification Checklist

Use the class filter to verify:

1. **Count Verification**
   - Income Generating should total ~749 bookings
   - Non-Income Generating should total ~72 bookings
   - Total should equal 821 bookings

2. **Revenue Verification**
   - Income Generating revenue should be primary
   - Non-Income Generating should be minimal/zero
   - Totals should match summary

3. **Bed Nights Verification**
   - Bed nights by class should add up
   - Compare to overall bed nights
   - Check for any discrepancies

4. **Income/Disbursements**
   - Income Generating should have high income
   - Non-Income Generating may have zero income
   - Disbursements should balance

5. **Outstanding Amounts**
   - Check if outstanding amounts are correctly attributed
   - Verify any anomalies by class

## üêõ Troubleshooting Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Verify Non-Income Bookings
1. Set Class filter: "Non-Income Generating"
2. Check summary shows 72 bookings
3. Expand years to see timeline
4. Verify no revenue expected
5. Identify if any should be reclassified

### Use Case 2: Analyze Income Trends
1. Set Class filter: "Income Generating"  
2. View summary for overall income
3. Expand years to see growth/decline
4. Check monthly patterns
5. Compare income vs disbursements

### Use Case 3: Spot Classification Errors
1. Set Class filter: "Non-Income Generating"
2. Check for bookings with revenue
3. These may need reclassification
4. Set Class filter: "Income Generating"
5. Look for bookings with zero accommodation
6. Verify these are exceptions (WB3964, WB3762, WB4193, WB4242)

## ‚úÖ Testing the Implementation

1. **Default View**: Both filters "All"
   - Should show status-based breakdown
   - All data visible

2. **Class Filter Only**: Class = "Income Generating", Status = "All"
   - Should switch to class-based breakdown
   - Only Income Generating data visible
   - Summary shows Income Generating totals

3. **Both Filters**: Class = "Income Generating", Status = "Confirmed"
   - Class-based breakdown active
   - Only confirmed bookings in each class
   - Combined filtering working

## üìù Data Processing Summary

The pipeline now generates:
- **Status-based**: `yearly_breakdown`, `monthly_breakdown`
- **Class-based**: `yearly_breakdown_by_class`, `monthly_breakdown_by_class`
- **Summary**: `by_booking_class`

All three structures work together to enable comprehensive filtering and troubleshooting.

The class filter now provides complete visibility into Income Generating vs Non-Income Generating bookings across the entire dashboard, making it easy to:
- Verify data processing
- Identify classification issues
- Analyze revenue patterns
- Troubleshoot discrepancies
- Validate calculations
